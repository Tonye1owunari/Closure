Sure, everyone talks about closures as the must have language feature, but how many people actually get what they are or how to use them? Darn few. It’s the language feature everyone wants to understand and the feature every traditional language wants to add.

Here’s the problem. According to many well-educated folks in the business, closures are hard.
But that’s really not a problem for you.
So without further ado, I give you the super-formal definition. If you’ve been trained well you should be thinking at this point, “Ah, this is the ‘get a
big raise’ knowledge.” 

#Closure, noun: A closure is a function together with a referencing environment.
